House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,

in each successive season of Game of Thrones. And the subsequent seasons
didn't lose narrative focus and get bogged down endlessly rotating between
an ever-expanding cast of characters.
