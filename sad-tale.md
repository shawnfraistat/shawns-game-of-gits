House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.

While he was indeed killed, his legend lives on. And a bunch of his kids live on.
And the rest of Game of Thrones will spend a lot of time on those kids.

Including the kid he did not father.
